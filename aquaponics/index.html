        <p>Aquaponics demand rising over the years. Yet, many people doesn’t exactly know what it is. Throughout this post, I will give you more deep insight more on aquaponics, but difference version from formal definition, so you will have a more glimpse about what actually aquaponics is.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="what-is-aquaponics">What is Aquaponics?</h3>

<p>Aquaponics is known to be a system of growing water-based animals and fishes including land plants in such a controlled environment. The purpose of this is to maximize the nutrients and energy used in the entire system and to harvest a lot of fish protein and vegetables.</p>

<p>Actually, aquaponics comes from the words aquaculture and hydroponics wherein the former is about the cultivation of water-based animals and fish while the latter is where plats are cultivated in water or in a sterile medium.</p>

<p>Actually, it was in China that Aquaponics first became known while other aquaponics system parts were developed in other countries. There were people who became interested in observing the relationships which have existed in the environment.</p>

<p>Aquaponics has also been explored in the past few years as the best solution to food shortage, energy and environmental issues. This is because this best combines the method of growing fish or aquatic-based animals (aquaculture) and hydroponics as the modern technology growing plants without soil.</p>

<p>In aquaponics, it actually follows the method of growing plants and fishes in such a closed loop system with water loss or low rate of water because of evaporation. As per the effluent or fish waste, it is to be delivered right from the tank to another settling tank. This way, the heavy waste will be removed and will be sent to the trays as a source of food for all those growing plants. The plants will now provide a filter in order that the water will keep the fish healthy.</p>

<p>In this regard, a symbiotic relationship will be established between the growing plants and the fish which served as an ultimate goal of aquaponics. A more sustainable ecosystem will be created wherein plants and fish can live and can thrive. This will now result to a more productive result such as healthy vegetables and fresh protein.</p>

<p>However, it must not also be forgotten that nitrifying bacteria or microbes are another third participant to consider. They convert ammonia that comes from the fish waster into nitrites while the solids into vermicompost. The latter is the perfect foods for those plants.</p>

<p>If you will compare aquaponics with the conventional soil-based gardening, the latter has a lot of problems faces such as amount of water needed, weeds, soil-borne insects, raccoons, four-legged pests and bunnies. Apart from it, there is a need to know the right time to water and the ways to fertilize. Even the soil composition must also be clearly known from the very start.</p>

<p>With hydroponics, these problems or issues will be resolved since this does not rely much on the application of man-made and expensive nutrients. There is no need to mix concoction of trace elements, salts and chemicals. There is just however, a need to feed the fish with inexpensive food scraps, fish feeds and grown foods.</p>

<p>Even the strength of the mixture no longer needs careful and consistent monitoring. The aquaponics will only need to be monitored during the 1st month. After it has been established clearly, there is a need to check ammonia and pH levels on a weekly basis. This is also in case that you have found your fish or plants stressed.</p>

<p>As compared to hydroponic systems, the water in aquaponics does not need to be replaced. There is only a need to top it off when it evaporates. In terms of diseases, aquaponics is not virtually exposed to diseases such as root rot or “Pythium”.</p>

<h3 id="aquaponics-and-its-history">Aquaponics and Its History</h3>

<p>Before aquaponics became popular in the 1970’s, the Aztec Indians already have grown their plants on rafts of a lake which also took place in 1,000 A.D. In the modern times, it emerged as something valuable in the aquaculture industry. Fish farmers also explored a lot of methods to be able to raise fishes and decrease their reliance on water, land and resources.</p>

<p>In regard with the first big scale facility for aquaponics, it is known as the Bioshelters in Amherst. In 1990’s, home based aquaponics have also been introduced in West Plains, Montana. People in Australia also became interested in Aquaponics that is the solution to solve the poor soil and drought conditions.</p>

<p>It was also in 2010 that aquaponic gardening community has been established becoming the biggest online place for aquapons in the northern part of America. Another book has also been published introducing the association for aquaponics in Orlando, in Florida. This was then used as a guide to building, maintaining, starting and designing a media aquaponics system which was already available before. Another book for gardening was introduced on Amazon site after a month which was alos printed four times and sold in 30,000 copies.</p>

<p>There were more improvements and developments that have been seen in aquaponics. So far, it got the interest of even an ordinary gardener and an environmentalist. In fact, the Aquaponics Association became more focused on commercial-based farming. The first ever Aquaponics Fest was conducted in Longmont Colorado, in August 2014 for school and home aquaponic gardeners.</p>

<h3 id="aquaponics-now-the-future-of-farming">Aquaponics Now, the Future of Farming</h3>

<p>Aquaponics is now the future of farming and the farming revolution. With the shortages of energy and water, it is just high time to consider this one. There is now a need for newer and sustainable sources of healthy and nutritious foods.</p>

<p>Good thing, there are companies and organizations committed to the commercialization of aquaponics systems that create better water for healthy plants and fishes. They have their teams that can share their deep operational, engineering and scientific experience in aquaponics. They can be delighted enough to share more of their insights and knowledge about aquaponics.</p>

<p>Truly, Aquaponics helps people in their gardening chores like in harvesting, tending of plants and feeding of fishes. There is also no need for toxic solutions to be able to grow plants.</p>

<p>Now you have clearly understood the meaning of aquaponics. For you to know more about the benefits of aquaponics and aquaponics system, read on the coming articles that highlight these topics for your greater understanding.</p>

<h2 id="aquaponics-system-overview">Aquaponics System Overview</h2>

<p>The technique of raising fish and growing plants has now come to a new level. In fact, today, you can now raise fish and grow plants in a manner that brings stability to the ecosystem. With, aquaponics system, you can just do that. Developing a self-sustaining system could mean a challenging task for some. But, believe it or not, it is good if you will stick with this system.</p>

<p>Aquaponics system is a combination of two processes- cultivating vegetables and fruits and growing fish at once. This is a closed integrated method of typical aquaculture or the growing of aquatic animals like Tilapia, prawns along with hydroponics or soil with less fruits and vegetables gardening.</p>

<h3 id="the-issue-with-typical-soil-based-gardening">The Issue with Typical Soil Based Gardening</h3>

<ul>
<li>Amount of water needed</li>
<li>Soil borne insects</li>
<li>Heavy digging, bending and back strain</li>
<li>Weeds</li>
<li>Raccoons, bunnies and other pests</li>
<li>Knowledge required in the ways and the time to water, fertilize the plants</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aquaponics-system-is-the-solution">Aquaponics System Is the Solution</h3>

<p>Aquaponics system changes this game by means of getting rid of weeds and insects from the garden. As per this system, it reuses resources which are presently considered as waste products. In this system, there will no longer be toxic that will run off from aquaculture or hydroponics.</p>

<p>This system utilized just 1/10th of water in a solid based gardening and even lesser water. Watering is also essential to this system. It is also approved that fertilizing is indeed important. You cannot under fertilize or over-fertilize it.</p>

<p>Gardening tasks are also reduced among gardener. Thus, one is just able to concentrate on the other tasks of feeding tilapia, tending and harvesting the plants.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-aquaponics-systems">Types of Aquaponics Systems</h3>

<p>Rather than utilizing toxic chemical solutions or dirt to grow plants, this system utilizes a nutritious fish with all the necessary nutrients needed for t plant development. Rather than discharging water, this system utilizes the plants as well as the media in which they cultivate to purify and clean the water.</p>

<p>Afterwards, it is now brought back to the tank. The water could still be re-used for an indefinite period of time. It will just need to be substituted after it has been lost in evaporation and transpiration. Two main techniques of growing Aquaponics are popularly utilized today.</p>

<h4 id="raft-or-deep-flow">Raft or Deep Flow</h4>

<p>This type of Aquaponics is popularly utilized for commercial purposes. Raft or deep flow system utilized a floating raft that is made of a floating board or Styrofoam with holes for the pots in order that the plants will sit properly.</p>

<p>In a raft system, raft sits in water that is alienated from the fish tank. The raft serves like a bio-filter of the water ravages from the tank. Through this kind of system, you will realize that when you feed your fish on it, the more plants will grow. Now, if you have enough room for planting, ensure to have an individual bio-filter in holding the waste from the tank.</p>

<h4 id="media-based-aquaponics">Media based Aquaponics</h4>

<p>It is popularly created for the yard Aquaponics system wherein one can see it even if he or she is far away. It utilized clay or pebbles for drainage and for cleaning purposes. The pebbles within the plant beds force in the directive of water flooding in the drainage. This is also to ensure that it flows constantly. This is also kept away from any obstruction that only interrupts the work of the system. But, the clay in the plant beds absorbs the water to keep the roots of the plants. This helps maintain its dampness without getting soaked up.</p>

<h4 id="nutrient-film-technique-or-nft">Nutrient Film Technique or NFT</h4>

<p>Another kind of Aquaponics system to use on either commercial or backyard system is the Nutrient Film Technique or NFT for short. On the other hand, it is seldom used. In this method, plants are placed in the pots. Only a little amount of water seeps from the bottom of the pots. This is also where the roots could access a small amount of water from it.</p>

<h4 id="indoor-aquaponics-system">Indoor Aquaponics system</h4>

<p>This system can help grow vegetables and plants while it cleans the water in the fish tank. It is considered as one of the most renowned Aquaponics system. People could make use of the typical aquarium.</p>

<p>However, just like other kinds of systems, you must be careful in dealing with plants and fishes. There must be a constant checking, a right filtration and a right water circulation. It utilized a five centimeter layer of river gravel beds technique for filtration. This helps filter the waste of the fish and let the good bacteria grow. You can utilize plants that no longer need direct sunlight. Thus, the fish could also benefit more from it as well.</p>

<h4 id="hybrid-aquaponics-system">Hybrid Aquaponics System</h4>

<p>This is a combination of media and raft system. Media beds serve as the filter of the waste prior to the water that comes in the raft system. This style is the center of “The Aquaponics Source’s AquaBundance” systems as it offers its planting flexibility, low maintenance and high productivity.</p>

<p>All kinds of Aquaponics systems are ideal to each kind of home. But, it does not matter if you have a big or small space in your home. This is for as long as that it fits your purpose of setting it up- commercial or home purposes.</p>

<p>If you like to use it commercially, then you must have a huge place to install your system. But all in all, it is the cheapest way of growing fish and plants. You will also be promised of huge harvests in time.</p>

<p>By using these interdependent subsystems, the Aquaponics technique facilitates the farming of plants and aquatic life forms in a limited space utilizing purely organic techniques.</p>

<p>Aquaponics is the latest way of contemporary farming. It’s the combination of hydroponics and aquaculture. This only means that you can raise fishes and plants in just a single Aquaponics system. If you like to install your own Aquaponics System, you can read more about the benefits of Aquaponics systems. You’ll get a lot of benefits from this system once used properly.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-aquaponics">The Benefits of Aquaponics</h2>

<p>The aquaponics is actually the combination of the recirculation of hydroponics and aquaculture. It produces both organic vegetables and fish in a natural, dynamic and pond-type of ecosystem that can feed others and more. In aquaponics, the plants and the animals in a system usually establish a symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>Actually, aquaponics is completely organic and grows at such a faster rate. It is new as it is about the combination of hydroponics and aquaculture. Below are a lot of benefits you can obtain from growing aquaponics.</p>

<h3 id="the-benefits-of-growing-aquaponics">The Benefits of Growing Aquaponics</h3>
