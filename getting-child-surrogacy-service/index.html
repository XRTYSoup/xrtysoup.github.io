        <h1 class="title">Getting the Child from Surrogacy Service</h1>
        <p>Science development really pushes people live into a different level. In the past, when infertility case comes as the main concern, the child adoption will be the only way around to keep the couple.</p>

<p>Traditionally, when the infertility problem is set on the woman part, it is possible to have the egg from another woman to get fertilized. But this kind of attempt has set quite a controversy. Some simply stress the thin limit between the pure good intention and the adultery possibility.</p>

<p>Thanks to the latest innovation, people now have less trouble because the gestational surrogacy will not use the surrogacy mother egg to get fertilized. This method simply makes use the womb as a place for the child. The surrogate mother has no genetical relation.</p>

<p>So, it will be a better setting for any intended parent who wants to stay away at a better rate from the hereditary issue and social accuse for potential adultery.</p>

<p>If you take the gestational surrogacy, this method may cost you more than the traditional surrogacy. This is set by the complicated procedure that happens on the reproductive facility. The surrogate mother cost usually ranges between $10.000 and $15.000.</p>

<p>But such cost actually is not a fixed cost. Some of the agency simply takes more rigid detail for the cost. You may need to pay for the mother living expenses reimbursement starting at $ 30.000.</p>

<p>More technical cost such as the embryo transfer cost and caesarian section fee will be the other detailed cost that you may need to understand in advanced. In the end you may spend more than $ 70.000 for the complete package. For this reason, it will be best to take your time about the contract detail.</p>

<p>Just like any other services, cost comparison may save you enough money. It is also possible to have this procedure at lower cost when you have it out of US. You can go to UK, Russian federation and India as the next alternative.</p>

<p>If you choose to do the surrogacy in UK, it is important to note that commercial surrogacy is illegal based on the surrogacy agreement act 1985. But the Human Fertilization and Embryology act 1990 will another reference worth to learn. The gestational surrogacy is legal in Russia. The intended parent should give medical indication for the infertility case such as the uterine cavity  or any other reasonable situation.</p>

<p>In Russia, the genetic relation to the child is not a major concern. India will let you to have commercial surrogacy legally. The clinic may charge you for only $10.000 up to $28.000 for the complete package. The thing is the child will have the surrogate mother citizenship.</p>

<p>At this point, it is also important to learn more about the inter-country surrogacy and immigration rules.</p>

<p>You need to make sure that the contract detail will give you a real assurance on the cost to be paid and the child status. For this reason, you need to build a good communication with the agency, clinic and the surrogate mother. It will give better chance to monitor the situation at better rate.</p>
