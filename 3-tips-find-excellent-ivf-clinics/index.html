        <h1 class="title">3 Tips to Find Excellent IVF Clinics</h1>
        <p>The practice of surrogacy has now become really common. A lot of women are willing to become surrogate mothers, while other women are grateful for having chance to have children. Of course, consequently, lots of surrogate agencies and clinics for IVF are emerging. IVF stands for in vitro fertilization, which means a mechanism that involves prospective father’s sperm and prospective mother’s egg to be implanted into one surrogate mother’s womb. It’s the most preferred surrogacy option, as the biological mother will be the prospective mother, not the surrogate one. It explains why gestational surrogacy has now become a business itself. However, everything regarding to health and wellness have never been business. That’s why it’s always wise for you not to be in hurry in landing at any IVF clinics. Make sure you choose the right and the professional one. Remember that you’re going to have anyone else to bear your future children, so basically you have two lives in your hand, the surrogate mother and the baby itself. Here are some tips you can do before ending up choosing one of the top IVF clinics.</p>

<p>n choosing IVF clinics, the first thing you need to stick on is its success rate. A lot of websites are now facilitating this feature to check on lots of IVF clinics’ success rate. Success rate is basically measured by the number of patient gets the whole procedure of in vitro fertilization successfully undergone. The procedure itself involves lots of treatments from egg and sperm collection, preparation, insemination, and so forth. In some reviewing website, you can choose to check each treatment success or the whole process’ success. I recommend you to check the whole one, since one treatment is related to one another and one unsuccessful treatment will surely affect another. The patients are divided into two NHS and private patients. In measuring the success rate, both are not differentiated. Some hospital may have different policy towards different patient, so you may check it separately.</p>

<p>Second, IVF procedures include screening or evaluation, such as polar body biopsy, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and screening (PGS/PGD). This screening is really important to check whether the genes carried by either the sperm or egg is healthy or carrying genetic disease. The success rate of each screening to figure out such misfortune will decrease the risk of genetic disease carried embryo, which also put into account of whole success assessment. It’s crucial to choose IVF clinic with high screening success rate, as the risk that burdened onto client is really. You can’t imagine if such genetic disease harm both your children and surrogate mother.</p>

<p>Third, see their additional services provided. Additional service is clinics special policy and concern towards different kinds of condition the patient may bring and curious about. Mother with Hepatitis A, for example, will have different treatment with usual patients. Mother with HIV will have more serious consideration and treatment, which makes them put into special service towards them into account. Some additional assessment, like egg and sperm assessment are also good to know. Make sure your IVF clinics have it if you want to get special treatment.</p>
