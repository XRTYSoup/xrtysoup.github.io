        <h1 class="title">An Example of School Social Work Report for Child Based Work</h1>
        

<p>Colleges and universities usually have a steady social work program or an outreach program and many of these educational establishments have their own courses and programs for a person to study and become a recognized social worker. One of the most common fields where social work attended to is for children and families.</p>

<p>Children are a great cause for social work because of the sheer amount of children hit by the problems of poverty. You can find thousands of children who suffer from hunger. There are many children without a home or without the sufficient funds to attain proper education.</p>

<p>When a college student steps into school social work it is not just enough to go out to a location and then hand out food, clothes and toys. It is very important to make a sufficient report that will be submitted so that both the government and non-profit organizations in charge of human welfare and child development will get a clear picture of the current situation within a controlled environment.</p>

<p>By studying a single report the government can learn the proper population of uneducated children below the age of ten or the number of children suffering from a specific disease. These reports will find their way into the human welfare department, the educational department, and the health department of the government.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-look-at-what-should-be-included-in-the-report">A Quick Look at What Should Be Included in the Report</h2>

<p>The system is actually quite easy when you come to think about it. The actual format is very similar to a charter plan or a detailed schedule. It will also resemble an accounting report or an auditing report. To get a good look, here is a quick prerequisites of school social work report for child based projects and organized events:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to include all the names of the people involved and their appropriate positions in the event, whether they are classmates, teachers, politicians or civilian helpers.</li>
<li>You need to have a tally of the total number of children assisted in the social work outreach program.</li>
<li>Supply the basic age range and gender population of all the children accounted for.</li>
<li>Include the details of when and where the program was conducted and for how long.</li>
<li>All of the accumulated costs must also be included in the report.</li>
<li>A separate document must be present as well and this document will provide the proof that the social work program was conducted with government and school permission as well as carrying the confirmed signatures of the people in charge.</li>
<li>Any casualty or serious case that may have occurred during the program must be listed as well.</li>
<li>If the outreach program was health related, the report must tally all of the illnesses and conditions found during the event to properly assess how frequent and what age or gender group the condition primarily targets within the location.</li>
</ul>

<p>All point mention above are the primary items that must be included in a school social work report. Of course the basic school requirements must be included as well. Include how the social work program had assisted the students in their studies, how it affected their outlook on social welfare and their responsibility to the nation and to their fellowmen, and how their program might have helped the children involved.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-help">How Does This Help?</h2>

<p>An accurate report is vital for the people with position to understand the gravity of the situation. Politicians and doctors all know that there is a level of poverty, illnesses and uneducated children all over the nation but without actual numbers and reports they will not get a clear view on how bad the scene actually is.</p>

<p>With a successful report the people in position can clearly see how bad a certain situation are. Most of the time even when they know of a bad situation they cannot make a move unless the proper documents have been presented that prove that such a case is evident.</p>

<p>Only then can they provide funds and sufficient movement for something to be done? With this given example of school social work report for child based programs, hopefully students can properly conduct their outreach programs and make a change for the improvement of the welfare, education and health of children in their local community.</p>
