        <p>This is a sample to recommend a permanent appointment in the point of view of the one who recommends somebody to a permanent appointment in the same company. Please take note of the characteristics of the person being recommended as also part of the qualifying standards set for the permanent appointment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Recommendation for A Permanent Appointment</em></p>

<p><em>(Name of Recommendee), of legal age, and a resident of (complete address of recommendee) is hereby recommended for a Permenent Appointment to the position of (Proposed Designation) in the (Specific Office) of the (Department/Company).</em></p>

<p><em>(Mr./Ms. Recommendee) is educationally qualified having finished (his/her) (current degree) which is more than the required qualification to the position. (He/She had also been with this (Department/Company)for the last (number of years) and has exhibited exemplary performance as (current position) in the (specific office). Please find, herein enclosed, (his/her) performance appraisal ratings for the last (number) rating periods.</em></p>

<p><em>Pertinent to this recommendation and for your perusal are some of my personal observations of (his/her) performance of (his/her duties and responsibilities as (his/her) immediate supervisor in the (specific office).</em></p>

<p><em><strong>a)</strong> (He/She gives (his/her) full time and attention to the affairs of the (specific office) and the (department/company) during the normal business hours and devotes extra time and effort on the job, whenever necessary, without overtime pay or expectation of the same.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>b)</strong> (He/She) works efficiently, diligently and honestly at any given project or undertaking, even those activities below (his/her)specific position. Once given a job to do, (he/she) always try to find a more efficient and economical way of doing things. Although, (he/she) does not necessarily need to be supervised, (he/she) asks questions pertaining the job to clarify certain points. The team of which (he/she) is a member always finish the job effectively and with time to spare from the set time frame.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>c)</strong> (His/Her) people and social skills are exemplary. (He/She) works well with (his/her) colleagues, regardless of whether they are higher or lower in rank. (He/She) is always invited to be part of a team and usually becomes the leader of the group. As observed. (he/she) could encourage others to do a job willingly and with zest.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>d)</strong> (He/She) has been trusted with, which (he/she) faithfully keeps confidential, any information, verbal or documented pertinent to the affairs of the (department/company). For this, (he/she) has been recently awarded &ldquo;Trustworthy Employee of the Year&rdquo; for having passed the tests unobtrusively given by several teams at different times of the year.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>e)</strong> (His/her) entrepreneurial abilities and expertise has been a valuable contribution to the Office where (he/she) had been serving. (He/She) had initiated several fund raising activities in order to help finance some of the outreach projects of the (department/company) that greatly augmented the (department&rsquo;s/company&rsquo;s) allocation that the outreach projects was able to accommodate more recipients and established the same in other needy areas.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>f)</strong> The only time that (Mr./Ms recommendee) has been absent for more than seven(7) working days was when (he/she had to bring (his/her) child to the hospital for treatment of serious injuries from a vehicular accident. (His/Her) daily time records show (he/she) has never been tardy nor did (he/she) leave before (his/her) scheduled departure time.&gt; Besides the aforementioned, (Mr./Ms. Recommendee) successfully passed, with a rating of Outstanding, the Preliminary Interview conducted by the Human Resource Office. All the seven members of the research team unanimously voted (him/her) very fit and suitable for a permanent appointment. According to the Chairman of the Research Team, it is very rare for the team to come up with a unanimous decision about a prospective appointee.</em></p>

<p><em>It is seldom that we find an employee with such exemplary working habits and attitude of work. It would be a great loss for our (department/company) should we find him working out of our premises. (His/Her) continued presence in our (department/company)will, most likely, influence our other employees to be as diligent and efficient as (he/she)is. (HIs/Her humble demeanor will likely have positive effects on the people (he/she) will work with as has been observed through the years.&gt; Since, there is a vacant permanent position, it is but fitting and timely to look into possibilities of offering (Mr./Ms. Recommendee) a permanent appointment in our (department/company).</em></p>

<p><em>May we, therefore, look forward to a kind and favorable consideration on this recommendation to offer (Mr./Ms. Recommendee) a permanent appointment in this (department/company). Your promt approval will be hightly appreciated.</em></p>

<p><em>Very respectfully yours,</em>
<em>(Recommending Official)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned earlier, this sample to recommend a permanent appointment is in the perspective of a recommending official. Nevertheless, anyone who is interested to apply for or recommend a permanent appontment to somebody would have an idea of what a permanent appointment entails and what companies are looking for.</p>
