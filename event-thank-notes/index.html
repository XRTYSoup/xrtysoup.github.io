<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Thank you notes after an event is a matter of etiquette, whether you are the head of a non-profit organization whose fundraiser was a success, or a bride who was recently married, there were people who helped with the planning of that event. If you do not graciously recognize the efforts and time spent by the people who helped you plan or execute the event in question, you stand a chance of burning valuable bridges that, in the future, you will regret burning.</p>

<h2 id="how-soon-should-i-send-my-thank-you-note">How Soon Should I Send My Thank You Note?</h2>

<p>Do not procrastinate, or the person (or organization) who helped you plan the event will think you sent the note as an afterthought, not because you sincerely appreciated her time and/or hard work. She will feel that such efforts were not worth acknowledging right away. As the Etiquette and Manners website states, you should send your post-event thank you note no less than 48 hours after the event. However, this does not apply to weddings, because people usually take into account the honeymoon period. Even so, the thank you note should be sent as soon as you return home from the honeymoon as is possible, whether by you or your designee.</p>

<h2 id="personal-thank-you-notes">Personal Thank You Notes</h2>

<p>A personal letter of appreciation to a person close to you– such as a family member or friend–should be handwritten, to add that personal touch. It should start with the date of the letter, followed by the friend or relative’s full name and address, placed in the upper left hand corner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Aaliyah Conners</p>

<p>19673 LaShana Blvd</p>

<p>Detroit, Michigan, 48229</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the next line, write, “Dear Aaliyah.” Since it’s personal, the occasion does not warrant the formality of referring to her as “Ms. Conners.”</p>

<p>In the very first sentence of the body–reference the specific event in which you wish to express your appreciation for Aaliyah’s participation. If she attended a recent fundraiser for your non-profit organization, you might begin your body in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Thank you for your participation in my planning my recent banquet for my non-profit organization, Loving With the Arms of God, which took place on Saturday,April 20. As you well know, dear friend, fighting homelessness and poverty is a cause that’s near and dear to me. And incidentally, because of your help, our organization raised well over the amount necessary to complete the paperwork for our 501c3.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then start your closing paragraph. According to the Daily Writing Tips website, this part of the letter should be about looking forward to seeing the person again. You may want to write something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I hope to see you again sometime in June when I am in town once again. As you know, I have family in Detroit, so my wife and I plan to visit them at that time.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you have reached the end of your letter. Close by saying, “Your Friend,” “Love,” “With Love,” “Best Regards,” or “Best Wishes.” Avoid more formal closing salutations such as “Sincerely.” Then put your name. Since it is an informal letter, you need not include your full name for this.</p>

<h2 id="formal-thank-you-letters">Formal Thank You Letters</h2>

<p>If the person you are thanking is a well-respected person in the community with a significant title, the rules of etiquette are more formal. As far as the beginning salutation is concerned, instead of calling the person Mr. or Miss, if the person happens to be a pastor, for instance,y ou would address the individual by their preferred title. Thus, you may start out by writing “Pastor,” “Reverend,” “Overseer,” or “Apostle.” Thus the heading may look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apostle Shawn Parker</p>

<p>210 Timothy</p>

<p>Ann Arbor, Michigan</p>

<p>48106O</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first line of the letter, you may write, “Dear Apostle Parker.”</p>

<p>Then go write into your letter. While, as the Writing Tips website indicates, there is some debate over whether, you should put information unrelated to the event in a more informal thank you letter, you should, in fact, stick to the topic at hand in a letter addressed to a pastor. Thus, the body may read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Dear Apostle Parker:</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you for your support at my recent fundraiser event held on Saturday, April 20 for the homeless. Apostle, your attendance and contribution were both well appreciated. With your help, we raised more than enough money for our 501c3 papers to be filed. We certainly look forward to your participation in future events.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of such a letter, since it is addressed to a pastor, you may use “Sincerely,” or “In God’s Service,” as a final salutation, then sign your full first and last name. If the person happens to be a professional contact other than a pastor, “Sincerely,” or “Best Wishes,” is the appropriate closing. Also, use the person’s professional title, or Mr/Miss or Mrs. when you address him in the letter.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The art of showing sincere appreciation after an event is something we should cultivate in our children. It is a matter of proper etiquette to express appreciation of an event. It serves to strengthen personal relationships, for people love to feel appreciated.</p>
