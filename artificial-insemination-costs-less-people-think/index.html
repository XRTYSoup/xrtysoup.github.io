        <p>Whether you are single women looking for a way to have babies without having to resort to love and drama or female couples looking for a way to conceive a child or simply couples who are stumbled on infertility issues, Artificial Insemination might be something which you would like to consider of.</p>

<p>So what is Artificial Insemination and how does it work? Well, putting aside all the complicated technical terms, to cut the long story short, Artificial Insemination can be overall can be described as a relatively simple treatments for infertility issues, which include small tube being placed directly into the uterus to transfer specially washed sperm to fertile the ovum. You may have heard other term such as intrauterine insemination or abbreviated IUI for short, Artificial Insemination and IUI are the same things.</p>

<p>Out of various choices of fertility treatments, IUI may be the first best tried, why? Not only because the cost of artificial insemination is relatively cheaper compared to other infertility treatments such as IVF, it is also easier to be conducted rather than any other assisted reproductive technologies (ART). But the drawback is, intrauterine insemination or artificial insemination has lesser success rate too compared to a more expensive in vitro fertilization. But anyway, it is worth trying for starters.</p>

<p>The average cost of artificial insemination is between $300 and $500. Some may charge up until $895 but that totally depends on many factors. That price is charged per pregnancy attempt, and depending on what clinic you visit, it will be varied a lot. Since the treatment is rather budget friendly and all, it is highly recommended that you go full throttle; opt for a reputable clinic with great ratings. Chances are, you will have higher possibilities of successful pregnancy attempt by going full throttle on choosing the clinic based on quality and great ratings, as opposed to choosing a clinic based on price only. Since it is less expensive and all, why not go for the best?</p>

Since it is less expensive and all, why not go for the best?</p>

<p>Another thing you probably would like to take into account is the percentage of a successful pregnancy by artificial insemination. Cheaper in price, but lower in possibility, that’s the setback here.</p>

<p>So if you want to make sure that you have better luck on this treatment, then it is highly advised that you repeat the artificial insemination treatment multiple times. This is an old trick many couples had used to overcome infertility, especially since it is rather affordable so several attempts won’t damage the budget department all that much.</p>

<p>Well, the chances of you being pregnant also determined by several factors such as age, fertility, body condition, and so on. Overall, this treatment has 10% up to 20% of success rate, which is actually not too bad at all if you decided to do the attempts for several times. Multiple your chosen clinic’s per session rate by five, then you’ll have a better idea about how much budget you will need to pay this treatment if the case is that you would like to anticipate for the financial aspects first. Despite how much the total add-up of the amount is, it will likely to be much less expensive in comparison to a series of IVF treatments or other similar treatments.</p>

<p>One thing you would probably like to keep in mind is how your insurance may cover up, at least, a portion of your treatment’s fees. Many still don’t aware of this, and some even missed out on the chance to be supported because of lack of information. The reason why your insurance companies would want to cover up the partial cost of artificial insemination is because the treatment falls under the category of infertility treatment, so it’s on the regulation. You should consider this option as it may also aid you greatly on your treatments. For further information, you should call the company and ask about the deal and what needs to be done to obtain it. Good luck!</p>
