<p>Sure, it is obvious that great things come in the equal price and sacrifice, and how it also rings true to the cost of IVF but also consider how it will be definitely worth a try and you may have a successful pregnancy in the process. You may have to fish out and dig out deeper for money from your pocket, but you also know how the saying goes off “you will never know unless you try”. Yes, that’s it, that also works in principal with coping out the most stress and despair-inducing prices you will have to pay for in Vitro Fertilization.</p>

And don’t ever think of giving up and take the shortcut by looking for a cheaper clinic offering a ‘cheap price’ for this, because there might be something omitted from the price description or if it doesn’t, then it is dubious in process and worth to be crossed out of the list of possible options. There is no shortcut for this; as there is no easy way to just reduce or cut off the price. You will have to fight this head-on like a true warrior, a budget warrior. And do you have what it takes to be a warrior? You are if you are willing to consider and realize these tips to make cost of IVF slightly more affordable:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Read all the insurance terms of conditions very carefully.</strong>
Some people are not aware that they are eligible for at least a partial coverage to cover up the cost for fertility treatments. This is partly because some of the insurance companies reluctant or unwilling to be clear about this particular information, and ignorance on the customer’s end.Do not assume that insurance won’t cover you, even if it will not cover all of the costly procedures, but, at least, it will cover some parts of it. Pay really close attention to all of the terms and policies listed, even to the smallest word. This is needed to be done as you have to know how to meet their rules in order to get some of their support.Once you’ve done this, the next thing you can do is to call the company or ask more questions regarding this, always have the policy list in hand as when they deny it, you have already armed with weapons necessary to refute it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Survey Clinics and Negotiate.</strong>
While some may be tempted to be loyal to only one doctor you have known or seen so far, but you will need to put your family’s financial well-being first while looking for more viable options both in financial aspects and health-safety-related aspects.When comparing prices, remember to dig and ask the clinics for as much as information you can get, ask what is included and what is not. A clinic may have a slightly expensive price because they include the cot for a blood test and ultrasound, while some isn’t. So keep in mind to ask everything that will be involved in the procedure along with its respective prices.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Save up money while buying fertility drugs.</strong>
The drugs are actually what make up a huge percentage of overall cost for in Vitro Fertilization cost, but with a little research, you can find out whether you are able to get a discount or even a better price. You can purchase your fertility drugs from a specialty pharmacy. Some of them will even go as far as to help you to negotiate for the best price if you are a member.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>IVF Refund Programs</strong>
There’s this thing called shared risk or refund policy when things went awry as the treatments are not successful. Make sure you have extensive knowledge about this so you will know what to do in case of anything happen. So here’s the gist of it; you pay upfront for multiple treatments in the future, with the average of cycles you can pay up are for three cycles. Then afterward, the program promises to refund all or some part of the paid money if it turns out the cycle take an unexpected, unwanted route within the cycle you have paid upfront.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ask for financial supports from external sources.</strong>
If you can stomach the uncomfortableness of asking cash, then you can try applying for fertility grants. The application can be expensive and they may not cover all, but it’s worth a try. Crowd –funding is also a viable option.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Borrow the cash you require.</strong>
The borrowing option goes beyond what credit cards can provide, you can borrow the cash from your family or your friends.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With those things said and done, you can expect the cost to be slightly affordable for you and your partner. It may be unpleasant at first but let’s face it; everything requires sacrifice and process for it to work.</p>

<p>Just remember that you aren’t alone and etch it in your mind that you are capable of overcoming any obstacle as long as you are willing to try and fight. If you are interested in crowd-funding and tips on borrowing money from relatives and friends, you can read the next section of part 2 and part 3. We hope the best for you!</p>

<p>How much does IVF cost? The average price is about $ 12,000 and may cost more depending on your needs and physical conditions. One thing that you can be sure about in Vitro Fertilization is that it will ultimately cost a fortune. With the nagging questions of “How much does IVF cost?” bugging in mind and the nagging urge to overcome it, there are some options worth trying to make it slightly affordable for you and your partner. One of those possible options is crowd- funding. So what is crowdfunding?</p>

<p>Crowd-funding is an act of raising funds from crowds, the basis of the whole premise is to collect a relatively small amount from large crowds, rather than getting large supports from the smaller group of people. Typically used by artists and beginners to get a funding for a project, this method also works for raising the necessary money required for an in Vitro Fertilization or other medical treatments, basically.</p>

<p>But like many of things in life, this crowd-funding obviously needs careful planning and wise course of actions to make it work. It may not be a thing for everyone to try, but if you and your partner are willing to give it a shot, then give it and keep reading.</p>

<p>First thing first to consider for crowd-funding is this question of why people would want to fund your cause. Most of the crowd-funding participants for this are most likely will come from the people you have known long, either from your family, relations, close friends, a dedicated reader of your blog, or even close pals from Facebook. These people will fund most likely join your cause out of sympathy and emotional connections, but how about strangers? Will they be sympathetic with you? What did approach need to be taken to gain their sympathy and make them willing to join your cause? Then you have to be tactful on the ‘promotional’ part of this want.</p>

<p>Consider online means as a start for your fundraising, you have to create an easy-to-search blog or websites and be sure to create it as neatly as possible. Second, you have to make your content clear but still heartfelt, you have to convince them that all you and your partner want is to have a chance to have a baby, laid out your goals and aims as clear as the day can get and be sure to keep in touch with your progress too, about how much you have tried and be friendly! Also, it will be more effective if your site is not only asking for supports but also offering something to the universe called the internet and to the crowds who visit it. You can post a helpful article on your sites or blogs, or you can even write down stories that will be both entertaining but enlightening at the same time, etc. Be creative with how you gain attentions and visitors. If you can do crafts or arts, then consider art-trade or commissions.</p>

<p>But always remember not to buzz it too much as you resort to spam or other annoying means as it will not do good for your reputation and your position as someone who needs as much as supports you can get here. Be thoughtful when you create your campaign materials and try to present your story as fancy and readable as possible, there will be a lot of people who will be visitors to your site so make sure that you keep the way you present it universal but still interesting and convincing enough to make people jump off to your bandwagon of financial supports. Always reach out to the social media as it is the one of the fastest ways to regain visitors.</p>

<p>After the deeds are said and done, remember to be always be grateful and don’t ever forget your donors or rudely severing up ties with them after you get what you want, be friendly, keep on being friends, and keep on maintaining and establishing a warm relationship with everyone, but careful as to set boundaries too as how much they can tread off and how much they can play a role in your actual life too and decision regarding IVF process. Good luck on your fundraising!</p>

<p>There’s a famous saying that goes like this, “Friends in need are friends indeed” and also, one that most of the people will have likely heard of on many occasions, “Blood is thicker in water”. When things gone awry and the cost of having an in Vitro Fertilization procedure to realize the dream of counter-attacking the infertility and go all the lengthy necessary way to have a baby proven to be just too much, family and friends are the ones you can turn your back to, as they will be likely to support your back and stay with you up until the end, as such is the essence of true family and friends.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you and your partner have tried a lot of necessary means and are still feel that you are short on cash, you can always ask both of your family and friends to join your cause and not only support you emotionally or mentally, but also financially, however, there are something that you and your partner need to take into account regarding borrowing money from relatives and acquaintances. You may follow some of these tips when the need to look for additional supporting money is kicking in and you are planning to turn to your friends or family for cash:</p>

<h3 id="consider-this-question-is-your-family-friendly-with-things-like-borrowing-money">Consider this question &ldquo;Is your family friendly with things like borrowing money?&rdquo;</h3>

<p>This is important both in the aspect of a relationship and financial. As bonds with family, while it may be tight for some but not too much for some people too. And the relationship is a tricky, delicate thing in the first place, anyway. There is undoubtedly worries and nagging questions as whether your relative is sincere and the kind that would gladly lend you the cash necessary without having to resort to perpetual reminders, digging out your guilty conscience, or unreasonable demands. You can see this sign if when you ask them for money they dictate what you should or shouldn’t do and how your treatments should be, then it is an alarming sign that they are not ‘friendly loaners’.</p>

<p>Even if they are your family, and even if they are lending their cash and pushing their advice on you, you are still you, you are the one who will undergo all the complicated treatments, you are the one who are still in control of your body and you are the one who will lead your own family. Remember, money doesn’t have rights to take your rights. Make sure to discuss this with your couple first, if both of you can come to terms of the agreement then drop the plan of borrowing money from your family and look out for other means. The infertility treatment is already stressful for the couples. You don’t need the unnecessary, additional stress.</p>

<h3 id="can-your-family-or-friends-afford-you">Can your family (or friends) afford you?</h3>

<p>If they are also struggling for their survival in daily basis then please, by all means, no matter how tempting it is, try to look for other options instead of burdening them.
Make sure they understand that the treatment won’t guarantee 100% success.
Don’t offer empty, hopeful promise of giving them grandchildren, niece, nephew, etc. if you already know how this thing called IVF works. Instead, you have to make sure that they understand there are still possibilities that the attempt will end up in vain, so they will not grief much or disappointed much if the treatment indeed fail.</p>

<h3 id="split-up-the-burden">Split up the burden.</h3>

<p>If you can have more than one relatives or friends to ask, and then suggest the possibility of splitting up the burden, you should discuss what’s the best course of action so that it will be affordable for all parties involved. And proceed cautiously. In vitro fertilization cost may be affordable this way but consider other things too, like point one and two.</p>

<h3 id="arranged-a-reasonable-payback-plan">Arranged a reasonable payback plan.</h3>

<p>Karma works, you have to pay for your debt sooner or later so it will be better if you carefully devise a reasonable plan to pay them back, either by saving up or sell things to cover it up.</p>

<h3 id="borrow-reasonably-pay-reasonably">Borrow reasonably, pay reasonably.</h3>

<p>Track every expense and the borrowed money or the already paid ones. Make sure you have some sort of tracker or notes to keep up with how much you have borrowed, how much you have paid back and also how much you have spent. This will help you to remember all and prevent any missed out debt.
All in all, remember to be always responsible for what you do, what you spent, how much you have borrowed and everything. Make sure to always be respectful and responsible with your loan. We wish you tons of good luck in keeping up the In vitro fertilization cost and the process itself!</p>
