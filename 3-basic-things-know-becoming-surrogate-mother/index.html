        <h1 class="title">3 Basic Things to Know before Becoming a Surrogate Mother</h1>
        <p>The practice of surrogacy becomes more common nowadays, as the medical warranty has developed very well that both surrogate mothers and the intended parties can trust the system. As the practices become common, more people seek opportunity to become surrogate mother as another professional job. However, surrogacy and pregnancy has never been such simple business things to do. It needs professionalism at the utmost level from lots of parties, including the prospective parents, surrogate mother, legal parties and the medical team itself. If you’re thinking of becoming a surrogate mother, check following things to make sure that you don’t risk yourself and end up getting a big loss.</p>

<p><img src="/images/3-Basic-Things-to-Know-before-Becoming-a-Surrogate-Mother.jpg" alt="Consider when being a surrogate mother. Baby’s feet by Eric Froehling" title="Consider when being a surrogate mother. Baby’s feet by Eric Froehling" /></p>

<p>First, always remember that the person who will bear the highest risk is always the surrogate mother. In traditional surrogacy procedure, for example, surrogate mother will receive the inseminated sperm into their womb. The chance to get STDs through the sperm is high if it’s done carelessly. Surrogate mother will be the one who’s going through the pregnancy state and all different kinds of periodical checks. She’s going to be the one who gets into pressure during pregnancy and lots of things to concern. There is also chance of miscarriage which may lead to further legal consequences. The labor itself is full of risk, including the life of surrogate mother and the baby. That’s why before putting surrogacy into action, always put your own self on the top priority and consideration, not money nor other parties.</p>

<p>Second, always go for professional procedure. There are basically two ways of becoming a surrogate mother, through agency and self-managed agreement. Both have gains and loss. However, in lots of practices, agency tends to take after all the things professionally, even though you may have smaller space to do anything you like when you’re already under contract. On the other hand, self-managed agreement requires you to take care of yourself, despite how little your knowledge about it. Unless you’re really knowledgeable about all aspects in surrogacy, you may miss lots of crucial things. In most cases of private surrogacy, you need to find your own client or you can start it with closest relatives in needs. As how usual business with families/relatives goes, things are so much flexible and negotiable. You may end up getting smaller or even greater compensation. Agency has contract for you to sign, so everything is fixed and nothing will harm your relationship when things need to be taken into legal actions.</p>

<p>Last, know very well your position in the entire procedure, contract and further legal actions. You may find that going to an agency will be really comfortable, especially the good rated one, as they tend to know what they do. However, don’t take it for granted. Learn lots of things about surrogacy from the experienced people and get into details when you’re negotiating with the agency. Read all the contents on the contract without skipping a bit as you can’t go back once you sign it. Pay attention especially on financial obligations and compensation, medical warranty and consequences when unwanted things happen during and after the process.</p>
