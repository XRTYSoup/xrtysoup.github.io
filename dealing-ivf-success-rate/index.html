        <p>Fertility is as old as human history. If you love to travel for the historic artifact, the symbolism for fertility is widely spread both in the East and west. It may come in a different way. But still, it’s been ages that people really take fertility as one of the important aspects of life. For this reason, through science people have tried to increase the pregnancy rate for those who have infertility case. The first “test-tube baby” was born in 1978 and named Louise Brown. Since then people has innovated the IVF into much better pregnancy and birthing rate.</p>

<p>The IVF success rates never reach 100 percent. This is set by the fact that different patient may have a specific case that will influence the successful rate. The basic thing that will influence the rate is set on the patient age. Women over 40 naturally will have lower pregnancy rate compared with younger women. The rate will be much lower when you also have cancer on your current health status. It has become common knowledge that cancer treatment will not only make your fall, at a certain level, it will also affect your fertility. The other troubling problem is set on the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) rate. High-level FSH usually will make the doctor recommend for egg donation for the better rate. But this point will be another way to lose the genetic relation with the baby. It is also important to take the sperm quality of the rate. For certain case, the sperm donor will be needed to boost the success rate.</p>

<p>You need to be objective when you find different IVF success rates on the different clinic. Most of the clinic that apply the conventional IVF procedure usually will have high rate successful pregnancy. You can take the Presbyterian Hospital/Weill-Cornell Medical Center New York City record as the reference for the high-level success with conventional IVF procedure. The clinic simply has 11.000 more babies on their success list. You will get lower success rate impression when you compare the rate at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Portland. You need to know that the clinic actually accepts women with 10 to 15 FSH level. It is the real reason for the lower rate. This clinic will be a good option when you want to keep your genetic ties with the baby when most of the reproductive clinic suggest you have a donor egg. Repeated failed pregnancy cycles will be the frustrating experience.</p>

<p>You will find the better answer in The Nevada Center for Reproductive Medicine, Reno. The clinic is currently researching for a new form of progesterone. It is expected that the result will help to sustain the pregnancy level. It is worth to note that the clinic report in 2004 has 70 percent successful donor egg program in women of all ages. For a woman with potential cancer treatment, a visit to Florida Institute of Reproductive Medicine, Jacksonville will give a real help. The center has the best freezing technique called cryopreservation. With the optimum environment for the frozen egg, so far the clinic already had 33 babies born. It is the most successful record in the USA.</p>
