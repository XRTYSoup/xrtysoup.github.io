<p>In this article, we would like to discuss the importance of knowing artificial insemination cost. We will start by discussing the background which impacts on the emergence of artificial insemination, the purpose of artificial insemination, and the cost of artificial insemination.</p>

<p>Nowadays, children have become the treasure for every family. Sometimes, children become the indicator of family’s prosperity. Many children in family define the higher prosperity of life within the family.</p>

<p>Yet, the willing to have a child is decreasing as the daily busy activities increases, though. The time required for work has overridden the time to care for a child. It leads to decide to not having many children.</p>

<p>Obstacles come up when people who are unable to have a child, still willing it. The couple is having a problem with their fertility as they cannot have a child naturally with a sex. It means that the man cannot inject his sperm into the woman’s womb by doing sex.</p>

<p>Also, in the transition beyond the post-modern era, some people have the unusual relationship, particularly the lesbians. In another side, they also want to have a child. Therefore, the technology of artificial insemination is emerging to fulfill the demand.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-artificial-insemination">What is Artificial Insemination?</h2>

<p>It is the unnatural process of fertility treatment where the man’s sperm injected to woman’s womb with the medical technology. It aims to make the fertility unnaturally through the help of a doctor.</p>

<p>The woman still can have the fertility inside her as well as letting the baby grow up inside the womb. The process of artificial insemination will be done in a short period of time. It means that the man should ejaculate quickly to support the process of artificial insemination.</p>

<p>If the infertility problem comes from the man, it means that they have to seek out for the donor’s sperm to support the process. If they have the problem within the quality and durability of man’s sperm, they can use the artificial insemination to meet up the sperm and ovum with the medical help.</p>
