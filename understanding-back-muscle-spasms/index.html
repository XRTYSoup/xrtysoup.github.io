        <h1 class="title">Understanding Back Muscle Spasms</h1>
        <p>Back muscle spasms are the involuntary tensing or contraction of lower back muscles. These back spasms can be very painful and, sometimes, can head you straight to the emergency room. This condition ranges from mild and infrequent discomfort to extreme and severe pain, making it difficult for you to move.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Back muscle spasms are effectively treated without the need for surgery; however, there may be a need for interventions if the pain involves any nerve problems in your spine. Every time you experience back spasms, stop and try listening to what your body tells you, because it may be tell you to stop doing the activity that caused it or it may be a warning of a more serious issue related to your spine.</p>

<h2 id="causes-of-back-muscle-spasms">Causes of Back Muscle Spasms</h2>

<p>Back muscle spasms can often be a result of particular injuries to your back tendons, ligaments, and muscles or caused by medical conditions. A common cause of back spasms is heavy lifting or any other activities that require excessive muscle and ligament straining and can eventually lead to injury. Sports such as golf and football can also cause back spasms as they demand sudden back turns, repeatedly. If your abdominal muscles are weak, your lower back muscles are even more vulnerable as your abdominal muscles help support your back.</p>

<p>Back muscle spasms may happen due to a couple of scenarios:</p>

<h3 id="1-protection-from-strain">1. Protection from strain</h3>

<p>Back pain and spasms could happen after an injury or strain on soft tissues, including tendons, ligaments, or muscles.</p>

<h3 id="2-response-to-anatomical-problems">2. Response to anatomical problems</h3>

<p>If you haven’t found relief and recovered from your back muscle spasms in two weeks and the pain reoccurs in the same back area, this can be a sign of an anatomical problem, particularly with your spine. These underlying issues causing you back spasms can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Degenerative Disc Disease</li>
<li>Spinal Stenosis</li>
<li>Facet Joint Osteoarthritis</li>
<li>Herniated Disc</li>
</ul>

<p>In these conditions, anatomical problems are commonly where the pain comes from. You experience back muscle spasms because your muscles are instinctively reacting to the inflammation and pain. If you experience this, it’s advisable to seek medical treatment for acute pain to treat the cause of underlying symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="muscles-that-contract-during-back-muscle-spasms">Muscles that Contract during Back Muscle Spasms</h2>

<ul>
<li>Psoas major</li>
<li>Latissimus dorsi</li>
<li>Iliacus</li>
<li>Erector spinae</li>
<li>Internal abdominal obliques</li>
<li>Quadratus lumborum</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="diagnosis-of-back-muscle-spasms">Diagnosis of Back Muscle Spasms</h2>

<p>An X-ray may be required by your doctor in order to see signs of bone fracture or arthritis. Computerized Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can also be a better procedure to look at your muscles and soft tissues. CT scan and MRI greatly help identify underlying problems with blood supply or discs in the affected area.</p>

<p>You can also describe your symptoms to your doctor for a more accurate diagnosis. Discuss how severe the back spasms are, how frequent do they flare up, what relieves them and when they started. Don’t forget to mention whether or not the spasms started right after heavy physical activities or a sports injury. This can help determine if your back muscle spasms have resulted from muscle injury.</p>

<h2 id="treatment-for-back-muscle-spasms">Treatment for Back Muscle Spasms</h2>

<p>As soon as you notice back spasms, the first thing you should do is to give it immediate attention and try to relieve the pain. The goal is to get your muscles to relax. The following are your first treatment for back spasms:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Muscle Relaxant</strong> — These are prescribed medications, they are not directly targeting muscles but have a total relaxing effect on your body. Muscle relaxants are normally prescribed for short-term acute and intense pain. Examples of these medications are Flexeril and Valium.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Therapy</strong> — Application of ice in a cold pack, towel or protective sheath to your back’s painful location can immediately relieve you from the flare of acute pain. Generally, cold therapy helps reduce inflammation which, in turn,leads to pain relief.</li>
<li><strong>NSAIDs</strong> — Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Dedication (NSAID) can relieve your back spasms by reducing inflammations. Over-the-counter NSAIDs consist in aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the Stress on your Back</strong> — It’s difficult to move with severe back muscle spasms because of the pain, but all you have to do is rest your back. Relax it, reduce the pressure and stress on your lower back. Lay down in bed and have your upper body be supported by a slight incline, place a pillow under your knees or sit at an inclined position using a reclining chair where you can slightly bend your knees and support your legs.</li>
<li><strong>Walk as frequently as possible</strong> — Always try to move or walk as much as you can.. Short and longer walks are better because prolonged inactivity may stiffen your back muscles which can cause even more pain. Walking gently promotes blood circulation and speed up the healing process.</li>
<li><strong>Heat Therapy and Heating Pads</strong> — The application of heat to your back’s affected area can give you a soothing relief from the pain. Some prefer the cold therapy but others find heat therapy more appealing to them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quick-tips-for-back-spasm-relief">Quick Tips for Back Spasm Relief</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rest immediately</li>
<li>Relax your body</li>
<li>Stretch slowly and carefully</li>
<li>Treat the affected area</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preventing-back-muscle-spasms">Preventing Back Muscle Spasms</h2>

<p>Your back is working hard to support you during your daily activities. Taking better care of it can help you prevent the occurrence of back muscle spasms and lower the risk of developing back pain. By simply losing weight (for overweight people) there is a great relief to the stress that your joints, muscles and spine are subject to.</p>

<p>Wearing shoes with low heels and having a straight posture contribute to lower back strength and stability. Performing regular physical routines such as exercises that strengthen your abdomen and back will keep you feeling and moving great. Avoid staying in bed or seated too much time because it may worsen your back problems.</p>
